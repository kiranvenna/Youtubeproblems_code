# SAS Youtube channel related data and code
I maintain a SAS channel, where I mainly discuss about problem solving in Base SAS, Proc SQL and SAS Macro.
I am trying my best to keep code and data for all my videos, so that anyone who want to try practise what has been
discussed in the video, can do it.
Below is my link to my channel
